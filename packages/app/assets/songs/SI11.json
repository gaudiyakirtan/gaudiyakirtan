    "translation":{"eng":"Śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana cleanses the mirror of the heart, extin­guishes the blazing forest fire of material existence, and diffuses the moonbeams of bhāva upon the white lotus of good fortune, causing it to bloom. Śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana is the life and soul of Vidyā-devī (the goddess of transcendental knowledge), who is His consort. Śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, causes the soul to relish complete nectar at every step, and enables one to be fully bathed, purified, and soothed inside and out. Let there be supreme victory for the congregational chanting of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s holy names!"}}
