    "translation":{"eng":"After the killing of Ariṣṭāsura, Śrīmatī Rādhikā and Her sakhīs exchanged many joking words with Śrī Kṛṣṇa concerning the necessary atonement for one who has committed the offence of killing a bull. As a result, the Queen of Vṛndāvana, Śrīmatī Rādhikā, and Her sakhīs joyfully excavated and filled Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa with their own hands. May that immensely fragrant Rādhā-kuṇḍa be my shelter."}}
