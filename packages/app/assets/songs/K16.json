    "translation":{"eng":"Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s bodily complexion reproaches the luster of a fresh rain cloud, kājjala, and blue sapphires. His garments shine more than saffron, the rising sun, and a flash of lightning. His entire form is anointed with sandalwood mixed with camphor and saffron. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa (Son of the king of cowherds) bless me with service to His lotus feet."}}
